## Glee Installation

Before installing Glee into your project, make sure you have pre-installed NPM, NodeJs and [AsyncAPI CLI](https://github.com/asyncapi/cli) tools on your system.

The best way to get started with Glee is by using AsyncAPI CLI, which sets up everything automatically for you. 
To create a project, run:

```sh
asyncapi new glee
```

> For more information on how to install the AsynAPI CLI, you can review the [CLI installation guide](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tools/cli/installation).

On installation, you'll find next steps after your project created:

```
Your project "project" has been created successfully!

Next steps:

  cd project
  npm install
  npm run dev

Also, you can already open the project in your favorite editor and start tweaking it
```

While making twists to your application, you can follow along with our getting started guide on the relevant page.
